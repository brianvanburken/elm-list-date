package helps with the conversion from and to elm's native [`Date`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Date).

## Installation

```bash
elm-package install brianvanburken/elm-list-date
```

## Usage

See [docs](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/brianvanburken/elm-list-date/latest/ListDate).
